        android:text="In the pages of history there lives no city more glamorous than Babylon. Its very name conjures
visions of wealth and splendor. Its treasures of gold and jewels were fabulous. One naturally pictures
such a wealthy city as located in a suitable setting of tropical luxury, surrounded by rich natural
resources of forests, and mines. Such was not the case. It was located beside the Euphrates River, in a
flat, arid valley. It had no forests, no minesâ€”not even stone for building. It was not even located upon
a natural trade-route. The rainfall was insufficient to raise crops.
Babylon is an outstanding example of man's ability to achieve great objectives, using whatever
means are at his disposal. All of the resources supporting this large city were man-developed. All of its
riches were man-made."
